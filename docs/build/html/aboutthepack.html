<h2>Simple Beginnings<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-beginnings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>TechNature began as a simple exploration modpack, focused primarily on designing the world to be as visually-appealing as possible.</p>
<p>We wanted to make something different from the standard of spawning in, punching trees, and digging a hole in the dirt to live in. People needed a reason to brave the open world and see what there was out there beyond the spawn chunks. There needed to be more than fancy colored trees or new dirt. There needed to be a sense of wonder.</p>
<p>The terrain is something I have yet to see in any modpacks so far, and is something we personally spent tens if not hundreds of hours just exploring, seeing all the new sights and wonders. Abandoned buildings, monster-infested dungeons, and mighty towers were just a few of the magnificent structures we found. Modified trees grown in shapes never before seen had us in awe. The drifting snows of the cold left our breath visible in the dim light of the aurora borealis, while tree leaves fluttered down around us in the autumnal forests. However, we soon wanted more…</p>
<p>After so much time spent in the world, it became apparent something was missing. While the world looked visually stunning, it just sounded… dull. After some changes, it was almost like a completely different place! Hearing the crickets chirp in the woods and the winds billowing through the mountains changed the world in a whole new way. Footsteps echoing underground, water trickling through the land, and leaves shimmering with the wind are just a few of the pleasurable noises we enjoyed in our new travels.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-purpose-in-life">
<h2>A Purpose in Life<a class="headerlink" href="#a-purpose-in-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We soon came to the realization that, although we had an amazing world to travel in, there was very little in the way of things to do. Sure, we could make some marvelous structures using Chisels, Bits, and blocks, but there wasn’t anything to put <em>in</em> them. As such, we slowly began adding a genre of mods we thought would make a good juxtaposition with the nature aspect: Tech. Heavy machinery has always been a favorite for many in modded Minecraft, and we were no exception. Mods were added and configured to make progressions entertaining, while efforts were made to prevent the maddening creep of grind from occurring. Recipes changed, mod intertwined, and all was good. Until…</p>

<div class="section" id="how-do-i-even">
<h2>How Do I Even?!?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-even" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In all of our changes to make everything interchangeable and entertaining, we forgot the most important part of any modpack: actually understanding it to play it. After another friend joined us who was unfamiliar with any of the mods we were using, he was immediately and utterly confused.</p>
<p>It was at this point we thought it would be a decent goal to work towards something we could release to the public, and so the polishing began. To help him, as well as others, we decided it was best to create a questing and progression system, not only as a guide, but as a reward for working through the technical side of things. We wanted progression to require work so as to not end up immediately with infinite resources and a burnout of what to do, but we also wanted it to not be grindy to the point of frustration. Our solution was a middle-ground of tiered progression and locking recipes to require progression in other mods. At first, things will seem slow, but very quickly it gets interesting as you are encouraged to learn, for example, how to work with Environmental Tech before progressing too far into TechReborn.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have put a lot of time and effort into this modpack, and while we enjoyed almost every second of it (see: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NicJames2378/TechNature">GitHub</a> and these docs!), we cannot say that everyone will like it the same way we did. As such, we are happy to hear feedback and suggestions over on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NicJames2378/TechNature/issues">the issue tracker</a> about what we could do to make it better! Thanks for playing, and have fun!</p>
